Interview Transcript1
ER-Ruihan Wu   EW-Bella Chen
Interviewer: Hi Bella, thank you so much for taking the time to join this interview today. Could you start by introducing yourself a little bit? Like your name, where you’re from, and what you’re studying?
Bella: Umm, sure! My name is Bella Chen, I’m from Anyang, China. I just started my first year here studying Communication. Everything still feels quite new to me, honestly.

Interviewer: That’s great, welcome to campus life! How long have you been in Australia, and what was your first impression of campus life here?
Bella: I’ve been here for about… three months now. At first, I felt super excited because the campus is really beautiful and much bigger than I imagined. But at the same time, I felt a bit lost because I didn’t know anyone and, umm, sometimes it’s hard to understand how things work here.

Interviewer: I see. Can you tell me about a typical day for you on campus? Where do you usually spend most of your time?
Bella: Mostly in the library, haha. I usually go to my lectures, then spend some time in the library doing assignments. Sometimes I go to the café near the student center, but… I don’t really join group activities yet. I feel a bit nervous to approach people.

Interviewer: Have you ever felt nervous or stressed when talking to classmates, teachers, or others on campus? Could you share a specific experience?
Bella: Oh, yes… actually many times. For example, in the first week, one classmate tried to talk to me during a tutorial. I was so nervous and worried about my English, so I just said a few words and then went quiet. After that, I felt embarrassed, and… I kind of avoided talking too much in class.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that. What kind of situations usually make you feel most uncomfortable or hesitant to speak up?
Bella: Group discussions, definitely. Like, when everyone is talking fast, I don’t know when to join in. And when teachers ask questions in front of the whole class, my heart races… so I usually stay silent.

Interviewer: Do you think language or cultural differences are part of these challenges?
Bella: Yeah, for sure. Language is a big one. Even when I know what I want to say, I sometimes can’t find the right words quickly. And culturally, people here are so open and casual. In China, I’m used to waiting for teachers to call on me, but here everyone just… speaks up. It feels intimidating.

Interviewer: When you face difficulties like these, how do you usually seek help?
Bella: Umm, I usually talk to my roommate first, she’s also from China. Sometimes we check online forums, like the school Facebook group. I’ve heard there’s a student counseling service, but I never tried it… it feels a bit scary, to be honest.

Interviewer: If there were a way to ask for help anonymously, like through an app or online platform, would you feel more comfortable? Why or why not?
Bella: Oh, definitely yes. If it’s anonymous, I wouldn’t feel judged. Sometimes I’m scared that people will think my questions are silly, so being anonymous would help me express myself more honestly.

Interviewer: Imagine there’s a campus map where students can post help requests or find safe spaces and friendly spots. Would you use it?
Bella: That sounds really cool! If I could see like… where there are events or quiet study areas, or even places where other international students hang out, I think it would make me feel less alone.

Interviewer: What concerns would you have about using this kind of system?
Bella: Umm, privacy, I guess. Like, I wouldn’t want my exact location to be tracked. Maybe it could just show general areas, not like a live GPS.

Interviewer: Looking back on your first semester so far, what’s been the most difficult moment for you?
Bella: Probably the first tutorial group presentation. I felt so stressed I couldn’t sleep the night before. During the presentation, my voice was shaky, and I almost cried. It was really hard.

Interviewer: Thank you for sharing that, Bella. Finally, if you could give advice to other new international students who might feel the same way, what would you tell them?
Bella: I would say… don’t be too hard on yourself. It’s okay to feel nervous, and it gets better with time. And also, try to find at least one supportive friend early on—it really helps.

Interviewer: That’s such great advice. Is there anything else you’d like to share about your experience?
Bella: Umm, I just hope the school can create more spaces for international students to meet locals in a natural way, not just formal events. That would make a big difference.

Interviewer: Thank you so much, Bella. Your insights are really valuable for our project. I really appreciate your honesty and time today!
Bella: Thank you too! I’m happy I could help.
